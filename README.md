## 🌟 The Problem

- Non-technical people have amazing ideas but can't build them
- Prototyping takes hours or days
- Traditional coding is intimidating for beginners
- Voice input is natural but underutilized in development

## 💡 Our Solution

SnapThought bridges the gap between imagination and creation. Using cutting-edge AI and voice recognition, we enable anyone to:

1. **Speak naturally** - "I want a to-do app with dark mode"
2. **Get instant results** - Working app in under 30 seconds
3. **Iterate quickly** - Try different ideas rapidly
4. **Learn by doing** - See the generated code and understand it

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Sponsor Technologies (All 3 Integrated!)

#### 🧠 Cerebras API
- **Ultra-fast inference** for real-time requirement analysis
- Powers the instant understanding of voice input
- Structures user ideas into actionable development specs
- Response time: <200ms (crucial for the magical user experience)

#### 🦙 Meta Llama Models
- **Llama 3.3 70B** for intelligent code generation
- Creates complete, production-ready HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Generates beautiful, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Adapts to user's style preferences and requirements

#### 🐳 Docker MCP Gateway
- **Isolated Preview Environments**: Each generated app runs in its own containerized sandbox, preventing malicious code from affecting the host system
- **MCP Gateway Integration**: Leverages Docker's Model Context Protocol for secure AI-generated code execution
- **Multi-Service Architecture**: Main app and preview environments run in separate containers with docker-compose orchestration
- **Zero-Trust Execution**: Generated code never touches the host machine directly - all execution happens in ephemeral Docker containers
- **Scalability**: Can spawn multiple isolated environments simultaneously for testing different app variations
- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Container-based architecture makes deployment to any cloud platform seamless

### Additional Technologies
- **Web Speech API** - Browser-native voice recognition
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid, beautiful styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Fast, dependency-free frontend

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Voice-First Interface** - Natural speech input
- ✅ **Instant Generation** - Apps created in <30 seconds
- ✅ **Live Preview** - See your app immediately
- ✅ **Code Transparency** - View and copy generated code
- ✅ **One-Click Download** - Export as standalone HTML
- ✅ **Example Templates** - Quick-start ideas
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive** - Works on all devices
- ✅ **Beautiful UI** - Modern gradients and animations

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
